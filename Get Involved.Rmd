  ### 1. Joining a PSU club
  I chose to join Korean Student Association because it was a great opportunity to get close with the people from South Korea and making connections. Since the beginning of the semester, I needed people that I can ask about school life and tips that could be useful as a Freshman in Penn State University. 

During the first meeting, we have introduced ourselves, and the original members introduced about the club specifically with their past achievements in penn state. It was very useful listening to their achievements because it gave me a brief idea of what the club would do this semester.

I believe that I will remain involved in this club because this club focuses on helping Korean students who have hard time getting used to the school and also create events that would entertain students in penn state. 

### 2. Try new things at PSU 
1. PENNEM (Koean Student Association)
I am happy to be a member of this club because I can help the new freshman next year the same help I have received this year, and I can get the brief ideas of what PENNEM does this year for the whole two semesters.

2. HOOPERS (Basketball Team)
I wanted to join many other sports team however, the only choice I can make was Korean basketball team because Korean baseball team did not go well this semester and for badminton club, there weren't space for me to get in.

3. OSTEM
  I have attended the first two to three meetings, and I thought I should definitely get into this club because the club introduces and travels to other states to visit career fairs and build stronge resume. However, during one of the meetings, the president has said that only few freshman would be picked to go to the career fair in other state. So, I thought this year is just for showing my existence to the club and thinking of trying for next year.

4. STAT club
  I believe stat club is a mysterious club because I have attended the first meeting when all the members met and introduce themselves in a small group. I have met several great friends but, unfortuantely, I had to miss the second meeting because I also had a PENNEM meeting at the same time, same day. Later, I could not receive any messages nor emails...
